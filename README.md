# Movement Range Maps
This repo contains a notebook that describes the processing of movement data made available by the Humanitarian Data Exchange. The data includes movement changes measured by Facebook throughout March to August 2020 starting from a baseline in February.


## Data Description
The location data from is obtained from Facebook users with care taken to ensure individual users are not identifiable. From these data we can compute the following metrics.

1. Change in movement metric - Number of 600 meters by 600 meters tiles people are seen in within a day.
2. Stay put metric - Percentage of people who are only observed in a single 600 meters by 600 meters tile
